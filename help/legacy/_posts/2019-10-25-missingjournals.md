Journal issues needed by ADS
============================

The ADS is looking for donations of the following publications for
scanning or for rescanning of color/gray scale images.

**The Astronomer**

v. 21 \#241 and \#247 (May and November)  
v. 32 \#384 (April)  
v. 33 \#388 (August)  
v. 35 \#412 and \#413 (August and September)  

We are also looking for [volumes of the International Cosmic Ray
Conference series]({{ site.baseurl }}/help/legacy/icrcstatus).

We will accept both bound and unbound good-quality copies of any of the
above volumes, giving preference to unbound ones when available. In
order for us to create electronic versions of these journals, we send
the volumes to a scanning company that cuts the spines during the
digitization process. Even though rebinding of the material may be
possible, we usually dispose of the journals after scanning but can ask
for them to be returned to the donor if necessary. Once digitized and
processed, these journals become available to anybody in the world for
browsing and printing from our [Web site](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu).

Given the non-commercial nature of our project, we especially appreciate
donations from people who are able to pay for any shipping charges
involved. While we are not allowed to send out self-addressed, prepaid
shipping labels to send journals to us, it is possible for us to cover
modest shipping charges if absolutely necessary using the following
procedure: once an agreement on the shipping cost and terms has been
reached between us and the sender and the package has been shipped, the
sender can invoice ADS for the shipping charges, and we will request
that a check be issued to cover these charges. Usually such refunds take
approximately one month to be processed.

If you have any material to offer, please contact:

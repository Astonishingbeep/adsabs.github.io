With the early release of the ADS libraries in ADS Bumblebee (Beta), we currently do not have a simple method to port your old libraries from ADS Classic or 2.0. However, this feature is coming soon.

Keep an eye on the [ADS news](https://adsabs.github.io/blog/news) or these [help pages](https://adsabs.github.io/help) for when this feature will be available.

You can search for papers associated with an ORCID ID using the syntax *orcid:[orcid id]* .

Please note that any papers you claim with ORCID using the ADS
interface can take up to **24 hours** to be indexed within ADS. If
your paper claims are still not registered after that time, verify
that you have supplied any necessary [name variations](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#user/settings/orcid).

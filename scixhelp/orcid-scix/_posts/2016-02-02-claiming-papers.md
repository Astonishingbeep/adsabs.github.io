### Recommended Method

If you care about having your ORCID claims searchable in the SciX.

1. **Make sure you're signed in to SciX.** If you are not signed in already, [sign in here](https://scixplorer.org/user/account/login) or [create an account](https://scixplorer.org/user/account/register).

2. **Authenticate with ORCID.** Click on the ORCID menu in the top navigation bar and follow the instructions.

3. **Enter a bit of extra information in your SciX User Profile.** If you haven't done so, on your [ORCiD Page](https://scixplorer.org/user/orcid) in SciX. Enter in 1) your current academic affiliation and 2) any name variations under which you might have published. Submitting these information will grant SciX permission to track your claims, allowing us to put your data in our system and marking it as trusted so that others can find it.

4. **Claim papers.** Search for your name variations in the search interface.
   Make sure ORCID mode is "on" (click on the ORCID menu in the navigation bar to toggle ORCiD mode). Claim papers individually by clicking the **Claim** button of an individual result. You can also claim multiple papers at once by selecting the check boxes next to the relevant search results and click the **Bulk Actions** dropdown and select **claim from SciX**.

5. **Check your claims in ADS!** Your ORCID claims take up to **24 hours** to be indexed in the SciX. After that, you should be able to search for your ORCID papers in the SciX by using the search term: _orcid:[orcid id]_.

### Alternate Method

If you just want to use SciX to send claims to your ORCID profile. (Most of your papers will likely still be eventually findable in the SciX, but they will be marked as less trusted than papers claimed using Method #1)

1. **Authenticate with ORCID.** Click on the ORCID menu in the top navigation bar and follow the instructions.

2. **Claim papers.** Search for your name variations in the search interface.
   Make sure ORCID mode is "on" (click on the ORCID menu in the navigation bar to toggle ORCiD mode). Claim papers individually by clicking the **Claim** button of an individual result. You can also claim multiple papers at once by selecting the check boxes next to the relevant search results and click the **Bulk Actions** dropdown and select **claim from SciX**.

3. **It's not too late to change your mind!** You can always sign into your SciX account (or create a new one) and submit the user profile information described above to facilitate indexing your claims in SciX. Without performing this final step, some of your claims may not be properly indexed in SciX due to our inability to match your name variations against the published records.

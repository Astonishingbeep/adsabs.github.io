You can search for papers associated with an ORCID ID using the syntax _orcid:[orcid id]_ .

Please note that any papers you claim with ORCID using the SciX
interface can take up to **24 hours** to be indexed within SciX. If
your paper claims are still not registered after that time, verify
that you have supplied any necessary name variations in your [profile section](https://scixplorer.org/user/orcid).

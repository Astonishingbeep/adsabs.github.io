## Who we are

The NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) is the primary digital library portal for researchers in astronomy, astrophysics, planetary science and heliophysics. The ADS corpus consists of over 15 million documents and is growing at a rate of several thousand per week. Every astronomy paper ever published and nearly every physics and geophysics article refereed in the past 20 years is fully indexed by the ADS. Over 50,000 scientists and librarians use the ADS daily, all over the world.

The ADS project develops and maintains services to facilitate the discovery and access of the scholarly literature published in the relevant fields of research.  The project embraces the spirit of openness long championed by NASA and the astronomy community in general: all the software we are developing is licensed under an open source license model and access to our data holdings is provided via an open API.

## Who we are looking for

The ADS project has two openings to join its team of ten developers and three curators. The successful candidates will be part of a small, agile team of talented, like-minded individuals who are solving difficult problems as a group.

We're looking for:

* a back-office [developer and data scientist](https://cfa.harvard.edu/opportunities/sao-employment-opportunities/posting-21-29) experienced in designing well-structured software, data pipelines and REST APIs. The successful candidate will enhance the ADS back-office architecture, improving the data processing pipelines and the public cloud-based API, as well as develop new functionalities to support the search engine and ADS natural language processing/machine learning plans. ([apply here](https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/601130700))
* a highly motivated [scientist](https://pweb.cfa.harvard.edu/opportunities/sao-employment-opportunities/posting-21-13) interested in performing statistical analysis and preparing datasets of enriched/tagged full text articles to be used as training and validating material for machine/deep learning models created by ADS developers. The successful candidate for this time-limited, part-time opening is a scientist (in astronomy or closely related fields), with experience publishing in astrophysics journals, familiarity with how theoretical and observational papers are typically structured, and knowledge of Python programming and data analysis. ([apply here](https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/597834300))

## What we offer

The ADS project is funded by NASA through a cooperative agreement and provides its services to the entire worldwide research community in astronomy and physics. We are hosted by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) in Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA), one the largest and most diverse astrophysical institution in the world. Here, scientists carry out a broad program of research in astronomy, astrophysics, and earth and space sciences. By joining our group, you will be actively supporting the discovery and dissemination of scientific results to the worldwide research community!

Some of the perks of the jobs include:

  * Work with a creative, multitalented team in a first-class academic environment
  * Generous benefits, flexible work hours, and (local) telecommuting options
  * Access to the astronomical community and events at the CfA and Harvard University
  * Engage with users at community meetings and present your work at scientific conferences in astronomy and information science

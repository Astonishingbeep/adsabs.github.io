Roman Chyla is the System Architect for ADS. He earned his PhD in Information Science from the Charles University in Prague (working on automated content analysis, i.e. computers reading newspapers), a Marie Curie fellowship at CERN. He worked for 6 months as a postdoc at CfA and later accepted a job with ADS. With him came what is now the core of the new ADS: the search engine, the query parser, citation searches, and other features that got developed later after he joined ADS fulltime in 2012. Roman designed and wrote major parts of our new infrastructure: the core of the API, microservices, the user interface internals, and most recently the data processing pipeline, and automated deployment of software components.

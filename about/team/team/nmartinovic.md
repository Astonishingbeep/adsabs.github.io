Nemanja has a lifelong fascination for astronomy and computers.

His astronomy interests led him to engage with various topics in astronomy from observations to numerical astrophysics. He got his PhD in astrophysics in 2017 focusing on cosmology and galaxies (dynamics, evolution and interactions) through cosmological and N-body simulations.

Among many other things he was president of the Society of Astronomers of Serbia, senior associate at Petnica Science Center, and has avidly communicated science to the public across all media platforms. He has worked as an astrophysicist at the Astronomical Observatory in Belgrade and the Mathematical Institute of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

While working in astronomy, his interest in computers enabled him to become a DevOps at ITekako company. There he eventually became the Head of the DevOps department and was involved in many projects for various companies across the globe.

His work as DevOps at ADS combines his love for astronomy and computers.
